## OIBSIP_DataAnalytics_Task1
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets:
1. Retail Sales Data → to study sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
2. Nutrition Data → to analyze calorie and nutrient distribution in food items.

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task was to explore the datasets, clean and preprocess the data, and derive meaningful insights using Python and visualization libraries.  

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
- Loaded datasets (Retail and Nutrition) into Pandas.  
- Performed data cleaning and handled missing values.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Created visualizations for trends, comparisons, and distributions.  
- Highlighted key insights from the data.  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook
